# odin-landing-page

The Odin Landing Page is my 2nd project in The Odin Project.

It's pretty rudimentary, and isn't even responsive or accessible.  But, from directing a musical to having my first child, I've been away from coding these last few months and needed a refresher on the basics.  So this is that.

I tentatively plan to come back and update this page with actual content, responsive design, and accessibility considerations.  Maybe I'll make it an actual tribute page to our dumb and perfect dog Rooby.
